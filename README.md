# Food Order App

Our first project using Flutter and Google Sheets API made specifically only for Arjuna Chiken Restaurant situated near Telkom University campus.

## How This App Works

This app works in line with Google Sheets. So, any changes in Google Sheets will be implemented into the application and vice versa.

## Installation

Because our app uses Google Sheets API you need to connect the app to it. Can be seen [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSSERiYLv3c). Credit to [Mitch Koko](https://www.youtube.com/@createdbykoko) for the tutorial :blush:
